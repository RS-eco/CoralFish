abstract = {Predictive habitat models are increasingly being used by conservationists, researchers and governmental bodies to identify vulnerable ecosystems and species' distributions in areas that have not been sampled. However, in the deep sea, several limitations have restricted the widespread utilisation of this approach. These range from issues with the accuracy of species presences, the lack of reliable absence data and the limited spatial resolution of environmental factors known or thought to control deep-sea species' distributions. To address these problems, global habitat suitability models have been generated for five species of framework-forming scleractinian corals by taking the best available data and using a novel approach to generate high resolution maps of seafloor conditions. High-resolution global bathymetry was used to resample gridded data from sources such as World Ocean Atlas to produce continuous 30-arc second (∼1 km(2)) global grids for environmental, chemical and physical data of the world's oceans. The increased area and resolution of the environmental variables resulted in a greater number of coral presence records being incorporated into habitat models and higher accuracy of model predictions. The most important factors in determining cold-water coral habitat suitability were depth, temperature, aragonite saturation state and salinity. Model outputs indicated the majority of suitable coral habitat is likely to occur on the continental shelves and slopes of the Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The North Pacific has very little suitable scleractinian coral habitat. Numerous small scale features (i.e., seamounts), which have not been sampled or identified as having a high probability of supporting cold-water coral habitat were identified in all ocean basins. Field validation of newly identified areas is needed to determine the accuracy of model results, assess the utility of modelling efforts to identify vulnerable marine ecosystems for inclusion in future marine protected areas and reduce coral bycatch by commercial fisheries.},

abstract = {Few in situ observations have been made of deepwater corals and, therefore, little is known about their biology or ecological significance. Deepwater corals (Primnoa spp.) were observed from a manned submersible at 11 sites in the Gulf of Alaska from 1989 to 1997 at depths of 161-365 m. We identified 10 megafaunal groups that associate with Primnoa to feed on the coral, use the coral branches for suspension feeding, or for protection. Predators on Primnoa polyps included sea stars, nudibranchs, and snails. Sea stars were the main predators, consuming 45{\%} and 34{\%} of the polyps at two sites. Suspension-feeders included crinoids, basket stars, anemones, and sponges. Most suspension-feeders observed at depths {\textgreater}300 m were associated with Primnoa. Protection seekers included rockfish, crab, and shrimp. Six rockfish species were either beneath, among, or above Primnoa. Shrimp were among the polyps, and a pair of mating king crabs were beneath Primnoa. These observations indicate Primnoa are important components of the deepwater ecosystem and removal of these slow-growing corals could cause long-term changes in associated megafauna.},

abstract = {The abundance and behaviour of fish on and around coral reefs at Twin Mounds and Giant Mounds, carbonate mounds located on the continental shelf off Ireland (600-1100. m), were studied using two Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) dives. We recorded 30 fish taxa on the dives, together with three species of Scleractinia (Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum cristagalli) and a diverse range of other corals (Antipatharia, Alcyonacea, and Stylasteridae). Stands of live coral provided the only habitat in which Guttigadus latifrons was observed whereas Neocyttus helgae was found predominantly on structural habitats provided by dead coral. Significantly more fish were found on structurally complex coral rubble habitats than on flatter areas where coral rubble was clogged with sand. The most common species recorded was Lepidion eques (2136 individuals), which always occurred a few cm above bottom and was significantly more active on the reefs than on sedimentary habitats. Synaphobranchus kaupii (1157 indiv.). , N. helgae (198 indiv.) and Micromesistius poutassou (116 indiv.) were also common; S. kaupii did not exhibit habitat-related differences in behaviour, whilst N. helgae was more active over the reefs and other structured habitats whereas M. poutassou was more active with decreasing habitat complexity. Trawl damage and abandoned fishing gear was observed at both sites. We conclude that Irish coral reefs provide complex habitats that are home to a diverse assemblage of fish utilising the range of niches occurring both above and within the reef structure. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that visual survey data provide more accurate fish counts than conventional extractive gear. As a result, use of underwater vehicles to assess the abundance and distribution of fishes has increased rapidly over recent years. However, a review of observations reported for 48 demersal marine fish taxa showed that almost all respond in some way to underwater vehicles. Whether or not movements or changes in behavior affect survey bias is more difficult to assess. A simple conceptual model is presented to evaluate relationships between stimulus intensity, distances from the vehicle where reactions occur, and survey bias. Largest bias is caused by attraction or avoidance that occurs outside the field of cameras or observers. While light level and vehicle speed have been explored experimentally in a few cases, much remains to be learned about how bias varies among species, age groups, different vehicles, and operating conditions. Given poor understanding of survey bias, we recommend that surveys be conducted with minimum possible variation in operations and that vehicle time is devoted to experimental evaluation of methods. There is no good substitute for direct observations on fish behavior, distribution, and abundance; and survey design can be improved through experimentation. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2008 NRC.},

@article{Koslow2000,
abstract = {Exploited deepwater ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}500 m) species generally exhibit clear "K-selected" life-history characteristics markedly different from most shelf species: extreme longevity, late age of maturity, slow growth, and low fecundity. Many also aggregate on restricted topographic features such as seamounts, and as a consequence are notably unproductive, highly vulnerable to overfishing, and have potentially little resilience to overexploitation. Since 1964, deepwater fisheries have contributed 800 000-1 000 000 t annually to global marine fish landings. Underlying this apparent overall stability is the "boom and bust" cycle that has characterized many individual fisheries. The accumulated biomass of previously unfished stocks is typically fished down, often within 5-10 years, to the point of commercial extinction or very low levels. Most deepwater stocks are today overfished or even depleted. Depletion of species from deep-sea environments that dominate mid to upper trophic levels may have long-term ecological implications, but the risks of reduced stock size and age structure to population viability, the potential for species replacement, and the impacts on prey and predator populations are not generally known. However, trawl fisheries have been shown to have potentially severe impacts on the benthic fauna of seamounts, where these fish aggregate. This fauna, dominated by suspension feeders, such as corals, is typically restricted to the seamount environment and is characterized by high levels of endemism, which suggests limited reproductive dispersal. The ability of the benthic community to recover, following its removal by trawling, is not known.},

abstract = {Little is known regarding bias attributable to fish behavior for visual transects conducted using underwater vehicles (UVs). Experiments were conducted under 2 ambient illuminations to assess the behavioral responses of 7 north Pacific Ocean groundfish species to a light stimulus that simulated the approach of a UV. Species included sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis, lingcod Ophiodon elongatus and 4 species in the genus Sebastes: blue rockfish S. mystinus, black rockfish S. melanops, copper rockfish S. caurinus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. Movement, as well as general activity, varied greatly between species. The most active species, sablefish, became agitated and moved away from the looming light source, while the least active species, Pacific halibut and lingcod, typically remained stationary. Of the 4 rockfish species, 2 demonstrated a strong response to ambient light level. Black rockfish and blue rockfish moved away from the looming light source, but avoidance was delayed under high ambient light. Bias probably differs among species, being greatest for those that are highly active and mobile, like sablefish. Further, ambient light may modulate bias, such that researchers need to be cautious about comparing results for surveys conducted at different depths and/or times of day.},

Carbon flows, 140 flows among 20 biotic and abiotic compartments, were reconstructed using linear inverse modeling by merging data on biomass, on-board respiration, $\delta$15N values, and literature constraints on assimilation and growth efficiencies. The carbon flux to the coral community was 75.1 mmol C m−2 d−1 and was partitioned among (phyto)detritus (81{\%}) and zooplankton (19{\%}). Carbon ingestion by the living coral was only 9{\%} of the carbon ingestion by the whole community and was portioned among (phyto)detritus (72{\%}) and zooplankton (28{\%}). Carbon cycling in the community was dominated by suspension- and filter-feeding macrofauna associated with dead coral branches. Sediment traps mounted on a bottom lander trapped 0.77 mmol C m−2 d−1 (annual average), which is almost two orders of magnitude lower than total carbon ingestion (75.1) and respiration (57.3 mmol C m−2 d−1) by the coral community. This discrepancy is explained in two ways: the coral community intercepts organic matter that would otherwise not settle on the seafloor, and through their action as ecosystem engineers, the increased turbulence generated by the coral framework and organic-matter depletion in the boundary layer augment the influx to the coral community. A comparison of macrofaunal biomass and respiration data with soft sediments reveals that coral communities are hot spots of biomass and carbon cycling along continental margins.},

abstract = {Biological structures exert a major influence on species diversity at both local and regional scales on deep continental margins. Some organisms use other species as substrates for attachment, shelter, feeding or parasitism, but there may also be mutual benefits from the association. Here, we highlight the structural attributes and biotic effects of the habitats that corals, sea pens, sponges and xenophyophores offer other organisms. The environmental setting of the biological structures influences their species composition. The importance of benthic species as substrates seems to increase with depth as the complexity of the surrounding geological substrate and food supply decline. There are marked differences in the degree of mutualistic relationships between habitat-forming taxa. This is especially evident for scleractinian corals, which have high numbers of facultative associates (commensals) and few obligate associates (mutualists), and gorgonians, with their few commensals and many obligate associates. Size, flexibility and architectural complexity of the habitat-forming organism are positively related to species diversity for both sessile and mobile species. This is mainly evident for commensal species sharing a facultative relationship with their host. Habitat complexity is enhanced by the architecture of biological structures, as well as by biological interactions. Colony morphology has a great influence on feeding efficiency for suspension feeders. Suspension feeding, habitat-forming organisms modify the environment to optimize their food uptake. This environmental advantage is also passed on to associated filter-feeding species. These effects are poorly understood but represent key points for understanding ecosystems and biodiversity on continental margins. In this paper we explore the contributions of organisms and the biotic structures they create (rather than physical modifications) to habitat heterogeneity and diversity on the deep continental margins.},

abstract = {Human activity in the deep sea is extending ever deeper, with recent research showing that this environment is more sensitive to human and natural impacts than previously thought. Some deep-water fish stocks have collapsed and fishing methods such as bottom trawling have raised international concern over the habitat damage they cause. It is likely that in its current form, deep-sea fishing is unsustainable. Diminishing reserves of hydrocarbons in shallow water are pushing exploration and production into deeper waters, which may cause damage to little known deep-sea habitats. The deep sea is also proposed as an environment where anthropogenic carbon dioxide could be stored to minimise the effect of its release into the atmosphere. At the same time, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may be altering the chemical equilibrium of the global ocean by lowering pH. Many countries are now beginning to designate some deep-sea habitats as marine protected areas in measures to reduce the damage caused by fishing and other anthropogenic activities. This review examines these current and emerging issues in deep-sea conservation and discusses conservation status and the designation of protected areas. The enforcement of protected areas using satellite tracking of vessels is discussed and applied to an internationally agreed deep-water conservation area, which aims to protect cold-water coral habitats on the Darwin Mounds in the north east Atlantic Ocean. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Seismic profiles, sidescan sonar data, bottom photography and sampling proved for the first time that there are giant carbonate mounds (bioherms) in the Rockall Trough. The Pelagia Mounds, on the northern Porcupine Bank, are relatively isolated whereas most of the Logachev Mounds, on the southeast Rockall Bank, form a field of closely spaced, contiguous mounds. They are all found on the upper slope at depths between about 500 and 1200 m and as a result of this study about 500 have been mapped. They have a variety of shapes and the larger ones are very steepsided, up to 350 m high and 2 km wide at the base. Sediment samples show that the mounds consist of pale coloured muds, mainly aragonite, usually with live and/or dead cold-water corals at the seafloor and with buried dead corals. Coral thickets appear to be detected as a brush-like signature on high resolution profiles and as a speckled pattern on high resolution sidescan sonar records. Shelly sands are found on the seabed between the mounds. Currents in the mound areas are strong enough to transport sands along slope as medium-sized sand waves and to prevent pelagic deposition, thus providing surfaces for initial coral settlement by the winnowing of fines to leave glacial dropstones and exposed rocks. These observations show that the poleward-directed upper slope current of the eastern North Atlantic extends further south than hitherto known and that there is a southwesterly directed current on Rockall Bank. There are waves on the Logachev Mounds, with a wavelength of about 20-30 m, that are thought to be moulded in carbonate muds by across-slope directed internal tidal currents and/or cascading currents. Mounds develop above erosional surfaces seen on seismic data. The huge amount of carbonate mud seems to be produced by the rapid growth and breakdown of cold-water corals living in a very favourable environment. Intermediate nepheloid layers formed upstream by the strong currents may provide the food source for the deep water suspension feeders. Conditions for giant mound growth require an ideal balance between current speed and sedimentation rate, among other factors. No evidence for the suggested link to methane seepage has been found so far. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mounds associated with the cold water coral Lophelia pertusa are widespread in the North Atlantic, although the factors controlling their distribution are not well understood. Here we examine a group of small, coral-topped mounds (the Darwin mounds) which occur at 1000 m water depth in the northern Rockall Trough, northwest of the UK. Individual mounds are up to 75 m in diameter and 5 m high, although some 'mound-like' targets seen on sidescan sonar have little or even negative relief. Some mounds are associated with 'tail-like' features, imaged as elongate patches of moderate backscatter up to 500 m long, elongated parallel to prevailing bottom currents. High-resolution sidescan images and seabed photographs show hundreds of coral colonies, each a metre or so across, on each individual mound. Many other organisms, mainly suspension feeders, occur in association with the coral. Piston cores from the mounds contain predominantly quartz sand with only scattered coral fragments, showing that bioclastic material is not a major contributor to mound building. A field of seabed pockmarks occurs immediately south of the Darwin mounds. On sidescan sonar data, pockmarks are low relief, circular depressions, typically around 50 m in diameter. The seafloor around the pockmarks consists of uniform, heavily-burrowed, muddy sediments and no specific biological communities, nor any sedimentological or photographic evidence for active seepage, were observed. The distribution of mounds and pockmarks suggests a gradual transition from mounds in the north to pockmarks in the south. This, combined with the lack of bioclastic material in the mound sediments, suggests that both mounds and pockmarks are created by fluid escape from below the seafloor. Mounds occur where fluids carry subsurface sand to the surface, where it forms mounds because bottom currents are not strong enough to disperse it. Pockmarks form where muddy material is eroded by fluid escape but dispersed by bottom currents. Despite the origin of mounds through fluid escape, we suggest that it is the elevated mound topography, rather than any fluid escape, that is advantageous to the corals. This is supported: (1) by the wide variety of suspension-feeding organisms that occur on the mounds, since all of these are unlikely to have a specialised seepage-related lifestyle, and (2) because corals and their associated community do not occur around pockmarks, where seepage has also occurred but elevated topography is absent. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The role of emergent fauna as physical habitat used by fish populations has been examined for a number of fish species in deep-water environments. Deep-water corals have been a central focus of such work during the past decade due to their sensitivity to human disturbance, slow recovery rates, and limited distribution. Some authors have suggested corals are important for mediating population processes of fishes while others have demonstrated minimal associations of fishes with corals. Further, the co-occurrence of fishes with corals does not necessarily mean there is a functional link to population processes. Expanded observational studies that include corals as well as non-coral features as shelter, sources of benthic prey, and sites with accelerated flows to enhance zooplankton prey delivery, are required to better understand the role that deepwater corals play in mediating the distribution and abundance of fishes. Studies are best designed to test a series of alternatives (or predictions) rather than simply testing for cases of no response (i.e., to a null hypothesis). The use of spatial replicates across regions and sampling over daily and seasonal time frames will produce information at space and time scales that can be applied to management of both major taxonomic groups.},

abstract = {Ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) was applied to the reef framework-forming cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa. The environmental tolerances of this species were assessed using readily available oceanographic data, including physical, chemical, and biological variables. L. pertusa was found at mean depths of 468 and 480 m on the regional and global scales and occupied a niche that included higher than average current speed and productivity, supporting the theory that their limited food supply is locally enhanced by currents. Most records occurred in areas with a salinity of 35, mean temperatures of 6.2-6.7 ??C and dissolved oxygen levels of 6.0-6.2 ml l-1. The majority of records were found in areas that were saturated with aragonite but had low concentration of nutrients (silicate, phosphate, and nitrate). Suitable habitat for L. pertusa was predicted using ENFA on a global and a regional scale that incorporated the north-east Atlantic Ocean. Regional prediction was reliable due to numerous presence points throughout the area, whereas global prediction was less reliable due to the paucity of presence data outside of the north-east Atlantic. However, the species niche was supported at each spatial scale. Predicted maps at the global scale reinforced the general consensus that the North Atlantic Ocean is a key region in the worldwide distribution of L. pertusa. Predictive modelling is an approach that can be applied to cold-water coral species to locate areas of suitable habitat for further study. It may also prove a useful tool to assist spatial planning of offshore marine protected areas. However, issues with eco-geographical datasets, including their coarse resolution and limited geographical coverage, currently restrict the scope of this approach. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The numerous stable isotope studies of scleractinian photosynthetic reef-building corals in tropical seas have demonstrated the complexity of the biological and environmental factors that give rise to their isotopic composition. Scleractinian non-photosynthetic corals of the deep cold water environment might be expected to reflect the more stable physical environment in the deep sea. However, in comparison, little is known about their isotope systematics. The present study concentrates on specimens of Lophelia pertusa from the north-eastern Atlantic, the Norwegian Shelf and Fjord. Aliquots taken from the theca represent time series and show variations in delta(13)C and delta(18)O of up to 4.7 and 2.4 per thousand, respectively. The variations seem to be related to morphological features of branching. The tendency of higher values near the tip of the polyps reported previously was detected only in some samples. The delta(18)O of the corals are in all cases more negative than the equilibrium values. There is a strong correlation between delta(13)C and delta(18)O forming linear arrays. The difference between these arrays is more pronounced in delta(13)C. The covariation of delta(13)C and delta(18)O indicates an overruling 'kinetic isotope effect'. This is in line with the behaviour of some trace elements. This isotope effect should be regarded as one manifestation of variations in partition coefficients dictated by a biological control on mineralisation (such as food or reproduction) rather than changes in the relative contribution of metabolic carbon affecting delta(13)C, and changes in temperature affecting delta(18)O.},

abstract = {Loss of habitat is commonly identified as a reduction in area (or patch size) and its effects are often investigated using species-area relationships to evaluate loss of biodiversity. In many habitats, however, area alone is not sufficient to explain the decline of populations because natural habitats are rarely homogeneous. In fact, reductions in the diversity of habitats (e. g. destruction of microhabitats) might have even greater effects on the diversity of assemblages. Although these are 2 well-known attributes of habitats (i.e. area and diversity), there have been few empirical studies that have attempted to separate their effects by experimental manipulation. Experiments were carried out to separate the effects of number, relative proportion and identity of patches of habitat using additive designs. Predictions were tested using assemblages of marine molluscs colonizing artificial mimics of macroalgal habitats on rocky intertidal platforms. Our experiments to disentangle different attributes of habitat heterogeneity showed that these are complex and highly interactive. In particular, not all heterogeneous habitats had the numbers of species expected from a simple species-area relationship. Instead, the presence of more species in heterogeneous habitats could, to a great extent, be explained by the presence or absence of particular types of sub-habitats and not just by patch size. The complexity we found in responses of assemblages to composition of heterogeneous habitats was not predicted and could not have been observed without appropriate manipulations of habitat composition. A mechanistic understanding of the associations between species and particular types of habitats is essential for better predictions of species' responses to loss of natural habitats.},

abstract = {Cold-water coral carbonate mounds, owing their presence mainly to the framework building coral Lophelia pertusa and the activity of associated organisms, are common along the European margin with their spatial distribution allowing them to be divided into a number of mound provinces. Variation in mound attributes are explored via a series of case studies on mound provinces that have been the most intensely investigated: Belgica, Hovland, Pelagia, Logachev and Norwegian Mounds. Morphological variation between mound provinces is discussed under the premise that mound morphology is an expression of the environmental conditions under which mounds are initiated and grow. Cold-water coral carbonate mounds can be divided into those exhibiting “inherited” morphologies (where mound morphology reflects the morphology of the colonised features) and “developed” morphology (where the mounds assume their own gross morphology mainly reflecting dominant hydrodynamic controls). Finer-scale, surface morphological features mainly reflecting biological growth forms are also discussed.},

abstract = {Twenty five blocks of Lophelia pertusa weighing a total of 18.5 kg were studied. Associ- ated with this substrate were 4 626 individuals belonging to 256 species. An additional 42 species were identified from loose coral rubble. Of the 298 species found, 97 are recorded for the first time from the area around the Faroes. Most individuals were found in dead coral blocks from the inner parts of the bank or colony, but a few species were found close to the terminal branches of live coral blocks. The associated fauna of this branching deep-water coral was as rich and diverse as that of hermatypic branching species of coral. Some physical features of the coral as a substrate were measured. Large blocks of live coral harbour a more diverse fauna than do smaller ones. In contrast, on dead coral blocks the number of species and individuals had no simple correlation to block size, indi- cating the importance of other factors such as random colonization and length of time the substrate has been inhabited. Of the 20 most abundant species only four showed a correla- tion between the number of individuals and coral weight. Ecological aspects of the associ- ated fauna are discussed and the results are compared with studies from associations on hermatypic corals. Comparing with studies of Lophelia banks from Norway and the Bay of Biscay we find very few overlaps in the associated species. A highly diverse and rich but facultative fauna is associated with the Lophelia banks. Andreas Jensen and Rune Frederiksen, Zoological Museum, Univer},

abstract = {OVshore banks and seamounts sustain diverse megafaunal communities, including framework reefs formed by cold-water corals. Few studies have quantiWed environmental eVects on the alpha or beta diversity of these communities. We adopted an interdisciplinary approach that used historical geophysical data to identify topographic highs on Hatton Bank, which were surveyed visually. The resulting photographic data were used to examine relation- ships between megafaunal communities and macrohabitat, the latter deWned into six categories (mud, sand, cobbles, coral rubble, coral framework, rock). The survey stations revealed considerable small-scale variability in macrohabi- tat from exposed Late Palaeocene lava Xows to quiescent muddy habitats and coral-built carbonate mounds. The Wrst reported evidence for coral carbonate mound development in UK waters is presented, which was most pronounced near present-day or former sites of topographic change, suggesting that local current acceleration favoured coral framework growth and mound initiation. Alpha diversity varied signiWcantly across macrohabitats, but not between rock and coral rubble, or between smaller grain sized cate- gories of cobbles, sand and mud. Community composition diVered between most macrohabitats, and variation in beta diversity across Hatton Bank was largely explained by Wne- scale substratum. Certain megafauna were clearly associ- ated with particular macrohabitats, with stylasterid corals notably associated with cobble and rock habitats and coral habitats characterized by a diverse community of suspen- sion-feeders. The visual surveys also produced novel images of deep-water megafauna including a new photo- graphic record of the gorgonian coral Paragorgia arborea, a species not previously reported from Rockall Plateau. Further interdisciplinary studies are needed to interpret beta diversity across these and other environmental gradients on Hatton Bank. It is clear that eVorts are also needed to improve our understanding of the genetic connectivity and biogeography of vulnerable deep-water ecosystems and to develop predictive models of their occurrence that can help inform future conservation measures.},

abstract = {A number of recent studies have linked post-settlement survivorship of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) with the complexity of the seafloor to which fish settle. Survivorship is greater in habitats of higher complexity (e.g., pebble-cobble substratum with emergent epifauna {\textgreater} pebble-cobble {\textgreater} sand), where cover provides shelter from predators. Fishing with mobile gear such as bottom trawls and dredges reduces the complexity of seafloor habitats. We used a dynamic model to (1) link patterns in habitat-mediated survivorship of post-settlement juvenile cod with spatial variations in habitat complexity, (2) simulate habitat change based on fishing activities, and (3) determine the role of marine protected areas in enhancing recruitment success. Density-dependent natural mortality was specified as three alternative functional response curves to assess the influence of different predator foraging strategies on juvenile survivorship during the first 12 months of demersal existence. We applied the model to a theoretical patch of hard-bottom substrata and to a case study based on seafloor habitat distributions at Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (Gulf of Maine, Northwest Atlantic). Our results demonstrate that patterns in the shape of response surfaces that show the relationship between juvenile cod survivorship and density as well as movement rate were similar regardless of functional response type, that juvenile cod movement rates and post-settlement density were critical for predicting the effects of marine protected-area size on survivorship, and that habitat change caused by fishing has significant negative effects on juvenile cod survivorship and use of marine protected areas can ameliorate such effects},

abstract = {Long-term (≤1-year) records obtained by seabed observatories (BOBO) and repeated (24-h) CTD casts show the presence of a highly energetic environment in and around two cold-water carbonate-mound provinces, on the Southwest and Southeast Rockall Trough (SW and SE RT) margin. Carbonate mounds, covered with a thriving coral cover, are embedded mainly in the Eastern North Atlantic Water (ENAW) and are observed in a confined bathymetric zone between 600 and 1000 m water depth. Cold-water corals seem to be restricted in their growth by temperature and food availability. The presence of living corals on top of the carbonate mounds appears linked to the presence of internal waves and tidal currents in the water column, and consequently carbonate mound structures are shaped by the local hydrodynamic regime. Mound clusters have an elongated shape perpendicular to the regional contours and corresponding to the direction of the highest current speeds. On the SW RT margin temperature, salinity and current speed reflect a diurnal tidal pattern, causing maximum temperature variations at 900 m depth of more than 3 °C. Current speeds up to 45 cm s-1 occur, and a residual current of 10 cm s-1 is directed along the slope to the southwest. At the SE RT margin the temperature of the bottom water fluctuates more than 1 °C with a semi-diurnal tidal cyclicity. Amplitudes of average and peak current speeds here are comparable with those measured on the southwest margin, but the residual current in this area is directed to the northeast. Tidal currents and internal waves at both margins force the formation of intermediate and bottom nepheloid layers and bring fresh food particles with increased velocity to the mounds. The distribution of corals in both mound areas is considered directly related to the presence of enhanced turbidity. An increase in temperature can be directly related to an increase in the amount of particles in the water column. Current velocity increases when a transition occurs from cold to warm waters. High current velocities prevent local sedimentation but provide sufficient food particles to the corals, so that the corals thrive at the mound summits. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Video transects from occupied submersibles were used to define associations of mobile megafauna (primarily demersal fishes and crustaceans) with microhabitat features including shell, burrow, biogenic depression, biogenic depression with adjacent burrow, sand wave crest, boulder, and burrowed clay outcrop. Sites were located on low-relief bottoms across the southern New England (USA) continental shelf and slope at depths of 55, 240, and 712 m. No significant diel differences in abundance were found for the 8 taxa censused at the 55 m (inner shelf) site. Non-random distributions and associations with specific microhabitats were found for the 8 taxa from diurnal transects and 6 taxa had non-random distributions from nocturnal transects. Silver hake Merluccius bilinearis and little skate Raja erjnacea were associated with particular microhabitats during the day but were randomly distributed at night. These shlfts In pattern are dttributed to diel differences in feeding behavior. Three of 6 taxa at a 240 m (outer shelf) site and 5 of 6 taxa at a 712 m (slope) site showed non-random distrib- utions and associations with specific microhabitats from diurnal transects. Observations with an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) at inner shelf sites (33 to 55 m) identified a distinction between species which produce biogenic depressions and species which later occupy abandoned depressions. We posit that associations with microhabitat features enhance individual fitness possibly by reducing contact with potential predators and enhancing the ability to capture prey. Use of microhabitat features occurs in assemblages where predators of focal organisms are abundant and possibly where prey density allows ambush predator tactics.},

abstract = {In this study the distributional pattern of the macro- and megafauna of a small (ca. 300 m(2)) Lophelia pertusa (L., 1758) reef was studied with a ROV (remotely operated vehicle). The reef is situated in a shallow fjord off the Swedish west coast. The number of taxa and their abundance in. transects from the reef itself and from 3 zones (Zone 1 = 50 m, Zone 2 = 100 m and Zone 3 = 200 M) around the reef were compared. Both the number of taxa (from 30 to 33 Tansect(-1)) and the abundance of individuals (from 21 to 7 m(-2)) decreased with increasing distance from the reef. Divided into ecological guilds, predators and filter-feeders decreased with distance from the reef (predators from 7 to 0.3 ind. m(-2), and filter-feeders from 13 to 6 ind. m(-2) from Zone 0 to Zone 3), while deposit-feeders increased with increasing distance from 0.04 to 0.4 ind. m(-2) from Zone 0 to Zone 3. Sessile species decreased more with increasing distance than mobile species, from 19 to 7 ind. m-2 and from 1 to 0.7 ind. m(-2), respectively. Our results also show that small deep-water coral reefs enhance local biodiversity, but the advantage to individual species depends on their mode of feeding and mobility.},

abstract = {The Porcupine Seabight is an embayment that takes a particular position in the NE Atlantic slope. Sonographs, a few current measurements and hydrodynamic modelling suggest the presence of a strong northward-flowing bottom current, locally enhanced by internal tides, affecting the eastern slope of the Seabight. At this location a province of coral banks is described, expressed as mounds lined up in along-slope-trending ridges. In this paper, very high-resolution single-channel seismic profiles are used to evaluate to what extent the bottom currents influenced the deposition of the sediments surrounding the mounds throughout the Late Cenozoic. Three seismostratigraphic units (P1, P2 and P3) can be identified in the Belgica mound area, separated by two margin-wide discontinuities (RD2 and RD1). Within Unit P1 (probably Early to Middle Miocene) upslope-migrating sediment waves are observed, suggesting strong bottom currents were already active in the Miocene. After an early Middle Miocene erosion event, represented by reflector RD2, an acoustically transparent layer (Unit P2) of as yet unknown lithology was deposited in the studied area. A second margin-wide erosional event, marked by the Late Pliocene RD1 reflector, removed a large part of Unit P2 and has cut deeply into Unit P1. Subsequently, the Belgica mounds were constructed spectacularly fast on topographic irregularities on the RD1 paleobathymetry. The onlap within the Quaternary Unit P3, which surrounds these mounds, suggests that the mounds were already present before the deposition of P3 and were big enough to affect the intensity of the currents around them. Furthermore, the channels and the mounds are, together with the complex oceanographic regime, the key morphological elements responsible for the shaping of a contourite system in the Belgica mound area during the Quaternary. One drift body is formed by an inferred south-north-directed current, with a drift levee and associated channel located on its western side. Between this channel and the mounds, large-scale sediment waves suggest an intensified bottom current running along the foot of the steep flanks of the mounds. The Belgica mounds are embedded in another drift body. Here, an interaction of bottom and turbidity currents is suggested, creating short turbidite channels at the southern and northern flanks of the mounds. Locally, small confined drifts can be observed where Unit P3 is deposited in a narrow passage made by the paleobathymetry of RD1 and the mounds. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Large mound structures have been discovered in the Porcupine Seabight (Northeast Atlantic) at a depth of 500-1200 m, associated with the growth of cold-water deep-sea coral species such as Lophelia pertusa (L.) or Madrepora oculata (L.). During the Training Through Research cruise in 1997, high-resolution OREtech sidescan sonar data were acquired over two provinces of these structures. This article focuses on the presentation and quantitative interpretation of representative sections of these sidescan data from areas around the Belgica and Hovland mounds. Several image analysis tools were used, but texture analysis, based on grey level co-occurrence matrices, gave the best results. Entropy and homogeneity indices were calculated, and the resulting images made it possible to discriminate between different seabed features on a quantitative basis. Mounds, moats and background sediments could be delineated accurately, and the image textures could be linked to the actual seafloor appearance through core descriptions and deep-towed video data. A major difference was found in the acoustic returns from the two provinces studied: the Belgica province shows much rougher textures. This is due to an actual difference in seabed roughness, caused by a difference in bottom currents and sediment dynamics in the two areas. The combined effect of the northward-directed North Atlantic slope current and superimposed internal waves and tides appears to be much stronger in the Belgica province. The reported difference in current strength might well influence the growth of the deep-water coral species in both areas. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) coral banks represent a rare example of living Lophelia-Madrepora-bearing coral mounds in the Mediterranean Sea. They are located between 350 and 1100 m in depth, in the northern Ionian Sea (eastern-central Mediterranean). Using a multi-beam echo sounder, side-scan sonar, high-resolution seismics and underwater video, the zones were identified for the sampling demersal fauna without damaging the coral colonies. During September-October 2005 experimental samplings were carried out with longlines and trawl nets inside the coral habitat and outside, where fishery exploitation occurs. No significant differences were shown between the abundance of fish recorded using longlines in the coral and non-coral habitat even though some selachians and teleosts were more abundant in the former than in the latter. Large specimens of rockfish (Helicolenus dactylopterus) and blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) were commonly caught using longlines in the coral habitat. Data from trawling revealed refuge effects in the coral habitat and fishing effects outside. Significant differences were detected between the recorded abundances in the two study areas. Greater densities and biomasses were obtained inside the coral area, and fish size spectra and size distributions indicate a greater abundance of large fish inside the coral habitat. The SML coral habitat is a spawning area for H. dactylopterus. The remarkable density of the young-of-the-year of the deep-water shark Etmopterus spinax as well as of Merluccius merluccius, Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides and H. dactylopterus, indicates that the coral habitat also acts as nursery area for these demersal species, which are exploited outside. Considering the evidence of the negative impact of bottom trawling and, to a lesser extent, of longlining, the coral banks can provide a refuge for the conservation of unique species and habitats as well as in providing benefit to adjacent fisheries through the spill-over effect both of eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Porcupine Basin, southwest of Ireland, was one of the earliest sites from where the deep-water corals Lophelia sp. and Madrepora sp. were recovered. These deep-water corals have since been found all along the Atlantic margins of Europe, in water depths ranging from 50 to more than 2000 m. Recent geophysical studies have demonstrated the mound-building potential of deep-water corals. Available data indicate that three major provinces of coral bank occurrences can be identified in the Porcupine Basin: (1) high-relief surface mounds which have a dimension of 1 by 5 km and a height up to 200 m ('Hovland' mounds), flanked to the north by (2) a swarm of buried mounds, somewhat smaller (up to 90 m), and with more irregular shapes than those recognised in area 1 ('Magellan' mounds), and (3) outcropping or buried, conical mounds (single or in elongated clusters, up to 150 m high) occurring on the southeastern slope of the basin ('Belgica' mounds). As far as can be inferred from shallow cores, the surface lithology predominantly consists of an upper layer rich in foraminiferal sand and terrigenous silty clay with intercalations of biogenic rubble. The banks host a remarkable number of colonies of living and dead Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata. The living and dead assemblages are underlain by a significant layer of coral debris in a muddy matrix. Deep-water coral debris together with a living association of the same species covers the surface of the 'Belgica' and 'Hovland' mounds, which may suggest that these corals have played a significant role in the development of the mound structures. The capacity for mound formation by scleractinian corals in the aphotic zone has been known for some time. Examples are found at different locations along the shelves and the continental margins of the North Atlantic. The role of the corals in these deep-water build-ups is still a point of debate. Though the genesis and initial control of mound settings in this basin might be related to hydrocarbon seeps, it appears that the major development of the Porcupine coral banks in recent geological times has most likely been controlled by oceanic circulation and dynamics in water masses and nutrient supply. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The use of baited cameras to study population parameters (e.g. abundances and size frequencies) assumes that members of this species follow odour plumes directly to bait, appear immediately in the field of view, and depart as predicted by optimal foraging theory. Described here are behaviours to the contrary observed during the operation and development of more complex baited camera systems. Of the 247 C. armatus observed by a video lander, 72.5{\%} of the fish explored the structure whilst only 6{\%} fed, and 21.5{\%} were indifferent. This exploratory behaviour increased individual staying time by 38.4{\%} compared to those that just fed. Experiments with several models of in situ fish respirometry lander showed the importance of both equipment design, and an understanding of the behaviour of the target animals in maximising capture success. These results show how previously unexpected aspects of behaviour by C. armatus can greatly affect the chances of capturing members of this species and influence the results of baited camera experiments. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In contrast to the terrestrial environment, where the use of landscape analyses has been clearly demonstrated, the influence of landscape composition and configuration on the abundance and spatial distribution of marine organisms remains poorly understood. Development of this area of marine research has been limited by the lack of accurate benthic habitat maps, particularly for marine environments deeper than can be penetrated by optical remote sensing (B10 m). However, the recent availability of detailed (1:25 000) and accurate habitat maps derived from hydroacoustic surveys of deeper marine waters has redressed this situation. The aim of this research was to establish the strength and significance of derived landscape composition and configuration indices on the demersal fish assemblage structure and spatial distribution. A combination of depth and 6 landscape measures were found to explain 34.8{\%} of the variation in the fish assemblage. Depth contributed the highest percentage of the variance explained, accounting for 23.7{\%}. Distance to reef was the most important landscape index explaining 7.1{\%} of the variability, followed by total length of edge environment (the interface between different benthic substrates) explaining 1.5{\%}. Species responsible for driving the structure of the fish assemblage were also examined and found to respond not only to the proximity of reef but also to the configuration of the reef. For example, Parika scaber and Pseudolabrus psittaculus characterised more heterogeneous landscapes offering clusters of small interconnected patches of reef with a lot of edge environment, whilst juvenile Trachyurus novaezelandiae and Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus preferred more homogeneous landscapes offering little reef or edge environment. This research demonstrated that a broad scale landscape analysis, employing indices of landscape composition and configuration, is important for understanding demersal fish assemblage structure and spatial distribution.},

Building upon extensive existing datasets, the Polarstern ARK XIX/3a cruise, deploying the robotic submersible VICTOR6000 (ROV), was undertaken in June 2003. This paper presents an overview of preliminary results from a reconnaissance video survey over and between several steep-flanked Belgica Mounds (giant mounds) and from a microbathymetric survey over some smaller mounds (Moira Mounds). Visual evidence for a strong hydrodynamic regime in the vicinity of the carbonate mounds is found with the interaction between currents and sedimentation having an important role in mound growth and development. Only some mounds show a high percentage of live coral coverage although there is a clear increase of megafaunal concentrations and species on mounds. One area of the province (the eastern ridge of aligned mounds) revealed very little live coral cover, asymmetrical drift accumulations burying the eastern sides and sediment-clogged dead coral frameworks at the western sides. This is in contrast to other areas (e.g., the western alignment of mounds) that show abundnat live coral cover at present. {\textless}in nearly all parts of the survey area the impact of fisheries, especially demersal trawling, is noted.},
